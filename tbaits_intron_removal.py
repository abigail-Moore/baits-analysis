#tbaits_intron_removal.py version 1.1 17 Nov. 2015 Abby Moore
#This script looks at the results from blasting genomic contigs against bait
#sequences and removes the intron sequences.  It is hopefully designed to be able
#to work with contigs made from gene families, where the exons might be in
#different places, unlike tbaits_to_exons.py
#version 1.1 has been changed to take LocusList as input and not rely on the BlastFileList
#File formats:
#BlastFileList:
'''BlastFileName [0] (bf2_nhd.out)
SeqFileName [1] (sf2_nhd.fa)'''
#LocusKeyFile:
'''PLocus [0] (apl1)
GLocus [1] (apl)'''
