#tblast_to_fastq.py version 1.0 10 March 2015
#This script reads the Seqs_to_Loci.txt output 
#from tbaits_blastn_parse.py or tbaits_blast_parse.py
#and writes files for each locus for each individual.
#It expects file with the header:
#Locus_Name	Individual_Name	Number_of_Hits	Sequence_Names
#and subsequent lines like (tab-delimited):
#18S	Lewisia_cotyledon_cotyledon_14	1	Lewisia_cotyledon_cotyledon_14_1308_1249_14445_R1;Lewisia_cotyledon_cotyledon_14_1311_17462_24991_R1....
#[0]: locus name
#[1]: individual name
#[2]: number of BLAST hits these sequences had
#[3]: semi-colon-delimited list of sequence names (from fasta file)
#These sequence names will need to be converted to the actual sequence names in the BLAST file to find the sequences

import sys #to talk to the command line
from collections import defaultdict #to make dictionaries with multiple levels
import gzip #We want to be able to open zipped files.
from itertools import izip #We want to be able to look at two files simultaneously (without having to
#have them both fully in memory at the same time
