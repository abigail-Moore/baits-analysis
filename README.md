# baits-analysis
scripts for getting full paralog sequences from fastq files from bait sequencing

The final plan is for the scripts to be in two parts.  One of them will be accessed through tfastq_assembly_master.py and the other through tcontig_classif_master.py.  The second of these scripts is finished, but the first is still in progress.  The scripts that it will eventually use are all finished and can be called individually, though.
